Forking and pull requests are essential concepts in collaborative software development.

- **Forking** allows you to create a copy of a repository under your own GitHub account. You can make changes to this copy without affecting the original repository.
- Once youâ€™ve made your changes, you can use a **pull request** to propose those changes to the original repository. 
- Pull requests facilitate collaboration by allowing project maintainers to review, discuss, and merge contributions.

By understanding these concepts, you can effectively contribute to open-source projects and collaborate with other developers!
